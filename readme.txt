## Design & Performance Tips:

* **Use lighter media**:  Compress images and choose short, compressed clips for images & video. Try to keep the total under 10-15 items so it runs smoothly.
 
* **Find balance**: Too many marquees on the screen at once can feel heavy. In most cases, one or two is all you need.
 
* **Load smart**: Turn on lazy loading when it’s available, and use thumbnails with overlays for images and videos to keep pages fast.

## Accessibility Notes:

* Provide ALT text for images that are used for information.
* Use SEO friendly heading levels (H2/H3) that match your page hierarchy.
* Offer pause or reading options for long testimonials or dense text.
* Keep animations subtle, and avoid excessive motion for users who are sensitive to movement.
