## 🧪 Proposed Testing Strategy
*The AI will describe how it plans to test the changes to ensure they work correctly and don't introduce regressions.*
- **Unit Test:** [e.g., Add a new test case to an existing suite.]
- **Manual Test:** [e.g., Verify the new control appears and functions correctly in the Elementor editor.]
- **Linting/Static Analysis:** [e.g., Run `npm run lint` to check for code style issues.]

## ⚠️ Potential Risks & Mitigation
*The AI will identify potential risks (e.g., breaking changes, performance issues) and propose how to mitigate them.*
- **Risk:** Modifying the core `widget.php` file could impact other widgets.
- **Mitigation:** The changes will be scoped locally and tested against three other widgets to ensure no side effects.
